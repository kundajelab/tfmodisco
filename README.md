Installation:
At the time of writing, the latest version on pypi is version 0.4.2.3 and can be installed using `pip install modisco`. This version is 0.5.0.1 and I am waiting for more testing before pushing it to pypi. To install this version, clone the repo and then run `pip install --editable /path/to/cloned/repo`.

Please see the following example notebooks:
- [TF MoDISco TAL GATA](examples/simulated_TAL_GATA_deeplearning/TF%20MoDISco%20TAL%20GATA.ipynb): a self-contained example notebook that uses pre-computed importance scores (generated by a neural network) as input. Scores were generated using deeplift as illustated in [this notebook](examples/simulated_TAL_GATA_deeplearning/Generate%20Importance%20Scores.ipynb)
- [TF MoDISco Nanog](examples/H1ESC_Nanog_gkmsvm/TF%20MoDISco%20Nanog.ipynb): a self-contained example notebook that uses pre-computed importance scores and an empirically-generated null distribution (generated by a gkm-SVM) as input. Scores were generated using gkmexplain as illustated in [this notebook](examples/H1ESC_Nanog_gkmsvm/Generate%20Importance%20Scores.ipynb)

A technical note describing version 0.4.2.2-alpha is available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00416](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00416).
