Release History
===============


Version 2.3.1
==============

modisco
-------
	
	- Fixed minor bug with final flank to add not being applied correctly.


Version 2.3.0
==============

modisco
-------
	
	- Add final_flank_to_add with default 0 to add padding to patterns at the
	end of the procedure.
	- Set default parameters for initial_flank_to_add to 10 and trim_window_size
	to 30. This sets the window size for patterns to be 50 instead of 30.
	- Add more command line arguments to expose seqlet lengths and flanks,
	initial pattern lengths and flanks, and final flank additions.


Version 2.1.0
==============

modisco
-------
	
	- Make motif database-based reporting optional.
	- Require Python 3.7.x to 3.10.x.

Version 2.0.7
==============

modisco
-------
	
	- Adds an error if the window is larger than the sequences.


Version 2.0.6
==============

modisco
-------
	
	- Adds an explicit casting of the one-hot encoded sequence and the
	attributions to 32-bit floats. This allows files to be compressed to
	16-bit floats to save space.


Version 2.0.5
==============

report.py
---------
	
	- Removes the use of the Arial Rounded font, hopefully reducing the number
	of warnings produced.


Version 2.0.4
==============

report.py
---------
	
	- Removed the need to supply both a MEME file with motifs and a directory
	with extracted PFMs. The PFMs will be read directly from the MEME file now.


modisco

	with extracted PFMs. The PFMs will be read directly from the MEME file now.


Version 2.0.3
==============

report.py
---------
	
	- Fixed a minor error where results would not display properly if fewer
	than the specified number of TOMTOM hits were found for a motif.


Version 2.0.2
==============

report.py
---------
	
	- Fixed a display issue where the patterns were being displayed in the
	wrong order.


Version 2.0.1
==============

Highlights
----------

	- A minor bug and a minor convenience issue have been resolved.


aggregator.py
-------------

	- A minor bug was fixed where, when collapsing patterns in the final step,
	some patterns would have no seqlets after the filtering step and the code
	would crash. Now, if a pattern has no seqlets after the filtering, it is
	ignored.


report.py
---------

	- The patterns are now displayed in numeric order 1-10, followed by 11-20,
	etc., as opposed to by alphabetical order 1, 10-19, 2, 20-29, etc.


Version 2.0.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- This is the first complete release that includes breaking changes compared
	with the original code. They are detailed below.


affinitymat.py
--------------

	- When calculating the coarse-grained resolution, an argsort is done to find
	the nearest neighbors of each seqlet. This is done in numpy using a sorting
	algorithm that is not stable. This new version uses "mergesort" instead of
	the default "quicksort", as it is a stable algorithm. This change allows
	us to use numpy within numba, assigning more work to each thread, and
	ultimately speeding the code up ~2-3x. 


core.py
-------

	- AggregatedSeqlet was renamed SeqletSet.


gapped_kmer.py
--------------

	- A bug in the original codebase where the nucleotide identity was done
	on the argmax of the contribution score, rather than the one-hot encoded
	sequence, caused incorrect nucleotide calls for positions that had a
	negative contribution. This effects only the gapped k-mer representation
	used to calculate coarse-grained representations, not the found patterns.


io.py
-----

	- This code was added to handle saving the outputs of the TFMoDISco function
	to disk and the conversion of the old outputs into the new format.


tfmodisco.py
------------

	- The output of TFMoDISco is now a tuple of two lists, where the first
	list contains the positive patterns and the second list contains the
	negative patterns. Each pattern is represented as a `SeqletSet` object.


Version 1.0.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- This is the first complete release that perfectly reproduces the outputs
	of the original TF-MoDISco code.
